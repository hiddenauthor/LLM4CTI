# Knowledge Graph Construction

This module implements the article-level knowledge graph construction phase of the LLM4CTI framework, transforming extracted triples from chunked CTI articles into a unified and structured knowledge graph.

## ðŸ”„ Workflow

The `Knowledge Graph Construction.ipynb` notebook implements the following pipeline to construct article-level knowledge graphs from raw CTI articles:

1. **Input Preparation**
   - Load the full text of a CTI article.
   - Automatically split the article into overlapping semantic chunks using `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter` (default: 400 tokens per chunk, 10% overlap).

2. **Chunk-Level Extraction**
   - For each chunk, create a structured prompt using `chunk_prompt_maker(full_text, chunk_text)`.
   - Use `ask_group_link()` to query the LLM in parallel and extract entities and relationships for each chunk.

3. **Chunk Response Processing**
   - Clean and format the raw LLM responses.
   - Wrap each chunk result with `[Chunk_i_START]` and `[Chunk_i_END]` for merging.

4. **Chunk-Level Merging**
   - Concatenate all chunk responses into a single merged block.
   - Use `merger_prompt_maker(merged_chunk_text)` to construct a final prompt for merging all chunk results.

5. **Article-Level Graph Construction**
   - Use another LLM query to merge entities, deduplicate triples, and add inferred links.
   - The final graph is output in JSON format with clearly defined entity and relationship sections.

## ðŸš€ How to Use

You can use this notebook to process a single CTI article and obtain a structured knowledge graph. Here's a minimal example of how to use the functions:

```python
# Load the full article content
with open('example_article.txt', 'r') as f:
    article_text = f.read()

# Generate the merged knowledge graph
graph_json = process_article(article_text, mode='o', server='local')

# Save the result
with open('result/final_graph.json', 'w') as f:
    f.write(graph_json)
```

### Parameters
- `mode='o'` sets the notebook to use optimized parallel chunk processing.
- `server='local'` assumes a local LLM is used. You may replace this with `gpt4o` if using OpenAI APIs.
