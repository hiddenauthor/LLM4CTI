Furthermore, the company states that there are limited, targeted attacks directed at Microsoft Word 2010. If exploited, this vulnerability (CVE20141761) could allow a remote attacker to execute commands remotely via specially crafted files and email messages.\nMicrosoft has also released preliminary details of the vulnerability and the exploit code. The vulnerability is exploited if a user opens an RTF file in Microsoft Word or previews or opens an RTF email message in Microsoft Outlook using Microsoft Word as the email viewer. It should be noted that Microsoft Word is the default email reader for Microsoft Outlook 2007, Microsoft Outlook 2010, and Microsoft Outlook 2013.\nSeveral workarounds were included in Microsofts initial bulletin, including disabling opening of RTF files and enforcing Word to always open said type of file in Protected View. A fixtool has also been made available to help address the vulnerability while Microsoft works on a more permanent solution.\nWhats interesting is that Microsoft Word 2003 is listed as one of the affected software for this particular vulnerabilityjust a couple of weeks before support for Microsoft Office 2003 ends on April 8th. We advise users to upgrade to later versions of the software to continue receiving security updates.\nWe are currently looking into this vulnerability and will provide further information as appropriate.
