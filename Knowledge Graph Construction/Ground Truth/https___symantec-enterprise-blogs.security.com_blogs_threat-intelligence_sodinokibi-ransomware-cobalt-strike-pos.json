for victims infected with Sodinokibi the ransom requested is $50,000 in the Monero cryptocurrency if paid within the first three hours, and $100,000 after that.\nTactics, tools, and procedures\nThe attackers leverage legitimate tools in these attacks, and at one point we observed a legitimate remote admin client tool by NetSupport Ltd being used to install components during these attacks.\nIn April, Symantec threat researchers found evidence of Sodinokibi attackers using similar tactics, when they spotted them using a copy of the AnyDesk remote access tool to deliver malware and other tools in at least two attacks.\nThe attackers in this campaign also use ‘legitimate’ infrastructure to store their payload and for their command and control (C&C) server.\nThe attackers are using code-hosting service Pastebin to host their payload (the Cobalt Strike malware and Sodinokibi) and are using Amazon’s CloudFront service for their C&C infrastructure, to communicate with victim machines.\nPastebin and CloudFront are both legitimate services but have been observed being exploited by bad actors for similar malicious activity in the past.\nThe advantage for malicious actors of using legitimate services to host payloads and for their C&C infrastructure is that traffic to and from a legitimate service is more likely to blend in with an organization’s legitimate traffic, and so is less likely to be flagged as suspicious and blocked.\nCobalt Strike is an off-the-shelf tool that can be used to load shellcode onto victim machines; it has legitimate uses as a penetration testing tool but is frequently exploited by malicious actors.\nThe tactics used in this series of attacks are similar to tactics seen used in other targeted ransomware attacks before.\nMicrosoft released research in April into attacks by six ransomware gangs, including Sodinokibi, and said that many of the groups employ similar tactics.\nThe vector for most attacks observed by Microsoft was either the exploitation of vulnerable network devices or brute-force attacks on Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) servers, and initial intrusion was followed by the use of living-off-the-land and commodity tools to perform credential theft and lateral movement before deploying the ransomware payload on multiple computers.\nSo the tactics employed in this attack campaign are tactics commonly used by targeted ransomware gangs.\nOnce on a network, the attackers take various steps to reduce the chance they will be detected and to increase the chances of their attack working.\nThe attackers attempt to disable any security software on the machine so their activity can’t be detected.\nThey also enable remote desktop connections so they can use them to launch malicious commands.\nThe attackers also appear to be interested in stealing credentials on victim machines, and are observed adding user accounts, presumably in an attempt to maintain persistence on victim machines and also in a further attempt to keep a low profile on victim networks.\nWe see the attackers using encoded PowerShell commands in some of these attacks.\nPowerShell is a Windows command line tool that has many legitimate purposes but is also frequently abused for nefarious purposes by malicious actors using living-off-the-land tactics.\nWe see the Sodinokibi ransomware deployed on three of the victims that were infected with Cobalt Strike.\nSodinokibi\nSodinokibi is a targeted ransomware - we saw targeted ransomware attacks increase by 62 percent in 2019, and targeted ransomware is one of the biggest threats on the cyber security landscape currently.\nSodinokibi (aka REvil) first appeared in April 2019, but the actors behind it are widely believed to be the same actors who operated the GandCrab ransomware.\nGandCrab was a highly active targeted ransomware that first appeared in 2018.\nHowever, in June 2019 its operators announced that they were ‘retiring’, claiming that they had made more than $2 billion from the ransomware.\nHowever, it’s widely thought that they simply turned their focus to the Sodinokibi ransomware instead.\nSodinokibi was originally believed to be operated by one group but it is now thought to operate as a ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS), where one group maintains the code and rents it out to other groups, known as affiliates, who carry out attacks and spread the ransomware.\nAny profits made are then split between the affiliates and the original gang.\nSince it appeared on the scene, Sodinokibi has been one of the most prolific targeted ransomware strains and has been seen in numerous high-profile incidents.\nActors using Sodinokibi were apparently responsible for the hack of foreign exchange service Travelex on New Year’s Eve.\nThe attack left the company offline for almost a month and caused huge disruption to its business, according to public reports.\nThe attackers were said to have demanded a ransom of $6 million in that incident, with Travelex reportedly eventually paying $2.3 million to regain access to its systems.\nIn January, it was reported that Sodinokibi’s average ransom demand was $260,000, so this was a huge ransom.\nSodinokibi hit several other high-profile companies in the last year and, similar to the Maze ransomware group, announced in December 2019 that it would release data stolen from victims if its ransom demands weren’t met.\nSince that announcement, the gang has been observed offering the data of victims for sale on hacking forums, and at the beginning of June an auction site was launched where the group said it will sell off stolen data to the highest bidder.\nVictims\nThe three victims that were infected with Sodinokibi in this campaign were in the services, food, and healthcare sectors.\nThe food and the services companies that were infected were both large, multi-site organizations that were likely capable of paying a large ransom - the type of company that would typically be targeted with Sodinokibi.\nHowever, the healthcare organization appears to have been a smaller operation.\nInterestingly, this victim’s systems were also scanned by the attackers for PoS software.\nIt may be that the attackers realized this business might not be in a position to pay the large ransoms usually demanded in a Sodinokibi attack, and so scanned for PoS software to determine if they could profit from the compromise in another way, or they may have been scanning for this kind of software simply to encrypt it too.\nFigure.\nThe ransom note seen by victims in this campaignThe\nattackers requested that the ransom be paid in the Monero cryptocurrency, which is favored for its privacy as, unlike Bitcoin, you cannot necessarily track transactions.\nFor this reason we do not know if any of the victims paid the ransom, which was $50,000 if paid in the first three hours, rising to $100,000 after that time.\nConclusion\nWhile many of the elements of this attack are ‘typical’ tactics seen in previous attacks using Sodinokibi, the scanning of victim systems for PoS software is interesting, as this is not typically something you see happening alongside targeted ransomware attacks.\nIt will be interesting to see if this was just opportunistic activity in this campaign, or if it is set to be a new tactic adopted by targeted ransomware gangs.\nOne thing that is clear is the actors using Sodinokibi are sophisticated and skilled and show no sign that their activity is likely to decrease anytime soon.\nThe companies targeted with this ransomware tend to be large corporate organizations, so companies like this need to be aware of the threat posed by this kind of activity.\nEndpoint Protection\nRansom.Sodinokibi\nTrojan.Agentemis (aka Cobalt Strike)\nIndicators of Compromise (IoCs)\nIndicators of Compromise (IoCs) 2d22d812117ff4ca4d8bcbd45ec20c77f52e907bf7320d44f6a4fd6c7beb066e  362fc55f5cd3d5338827de0eafdb7eb34c26885345706852184db95ad9996a5c  462257012d62ead365af0198457c64cc07a0597461ce79496c0f22b91273dcde  982f8e3329ef811bde84fd0cd5009dbfda6ed5e22e10eea796ac128e787f4f50  d41fd38a8478bf788f5dc0acf0e070dd360ddc9bfff0804e6b5254cc0116aa81  102.129.224.148  23.81.143.21  5.101.0.202  d2zblloliromfu.cloudfront.net  https://pastebin.com/raw/09FvgM1g  https://pastebin.com/raw/4DhjNfkK  https://pastebin.com/raw/kehkNbH6  https://pastebin.com/raw/Q9FdzgH2  https://pastebin.com/raw/QtwtkUR0 Symantec Enterprise Blogs\nYou might also enjoy 7 Min ReadTargeted Ransomware:\nProliferating Menace Threatens OrganizationsWith several new targeted ransomware groups emerging over the past two years\n, the number of organizations being hit by targeted ransomware attacks has multiplied.\nAbout the AuthorThreat Hunter TeamSymantecThe Threat Hunter Team is a group of security experts within Symantec whose mission is to investigate targeted attacks, drive enhanced protection in Symantec products, and offer analysis that helps customers respond to attacks.\nReadBillbug: State-sponsored Actor Targets Cert Authority, Government Agencies in Multiple Asian CountriesPosted: 28 Oct, 20229 Min\nReadCranefly: Threat Actor Uses Previously Unseen Techniques and Tools in Stealthy CampaignPosted: 21 Oct, 20228 Min\nReadExbyte: BlackByte Ransomware Attackers Deploy New Exfiltration ToolPosted: 18 Oct, 202210 Min\nReadSpyder Loader: Malware Seen in Recent Campaign Targeting Organizations in Hong Kong SubscribeFollowtwitterlinkedinPrivacy PolicyCookie PolicyData Processing and Data TransfersSupplier ResponsibilityTerms of UseSitemapCopyright © 2005-2022 Broadcom.",
