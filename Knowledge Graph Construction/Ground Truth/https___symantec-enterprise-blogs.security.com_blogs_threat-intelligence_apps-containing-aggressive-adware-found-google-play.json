EpicOmegaApps's Sim Unlocker app comes complete with a title and description page, making it seem legitimateAll 11 apps by this developer were published in December 2017, with each having an installation count ranging from 50 to 50,000.\nOne app named Sim Unlocker promises to unlock SIM cards so users can use any other SIM network operator.\nAnother app, called Remote Mouse Pro, claims it can convert the user’s phone into a wireless mouse.\nAfter users install the apps, they are subjected to a series of guided screens, with advertisements popping up at every single Next button pressed.\nHowever, despite the detailed descriptions for the apps, they provide none of the described functionalities.\nAll these apps manifest identical behaviors upon launching: after users install the apps, they are subjected to a series of guided screens, with advertisements popping up at every single Next button pressed.\nHowever, despite the detailed descriptions for the apps, they provide none of the described functionalities.\nFigure 2. Similar screens of Sim Unlocker and Remote Mouse Pro that prompt users to enter their user names.\nAds aggressively pop up at each click of the Next button.\nA quick glance at the app reviews reveals a long list of complaints regarding these apps’ failure to deliver their promised functionalities, not to mention the aggressive advertising behavior.\nFigure 3. User reviews for the Sim Unlocker app on the Play Store indicate users do not get the promised functionalityWe’ve\nseen another developer, called Pinwheel, which published at least 40 identical fraudulent apps.\nSome of these apps were named after popular games and movies, such as Far Cry and 13 Reasons Why, to entice users to install them.\nFigure 4. Pinwheel uses misleading names from popular movies and games to entice users\nWhen launched, these apps show users only an image that’s similar to the Play Store app’s image, with very aggressive advertisement pop-ups.\nUnbeknownst to the user, the image displayed is not an actual splash screen, but rather a static image.\nFigure 5. Pinwheel displays a make-believe splash screen, with many advertisements pushedThese apps were uploaded to Google Play in June 2018.\nAs of this writing, the developer appeared to still be uploading such fake apps, which had a total installation count of at least 13,000.\nTable 1. Details of the apps that contain a huge discrepancy between content and descriptions/titlesMinimal functionality that doesn’t match the description/title\nWhile the first category lists apps that provide no functionality at all, this one includes apps that provide at least one—however, the functionality is different from what appears in the description.\nWe found two identical apps developed by Zaybra, localized in the Arabic and English language.\nThese masquerade as mobile phone number tracker apps, but the only functionality both provide is announcing the phone number of incoming text messages and calls.\nThis behavior is not listed in the Play Store’s description and title.\nThese apps also push aggressive advertisements to users.\nThe two apps were uploaded to the Play Store between January and May 2018, with total download counts of 11,000.\nFigure 6.\nThe app, whose title translates to “Reveal the caller's name and place for free”, provides at least one functionality but it differs from the description Table 2.\nDetails of the apps that have minimal functionalities that do not match with their descriptions/titlesApp content matches the description/title, but no real functionality provided\nWe also found data recovery apps by Simple Designs Ltd, which were published in May 2018, with a total of 34,000 downloads.\nThese apps have a legitimate-looking user interface, but do not provide the promised functionalities.\nThese apps deceive users by giving a false impression that they indeed work as described.\nHowever, these apps do not actually recover any data.\nRather, they just display the data that still exists on the user’s device.\nAside from this fraudulent behavior, these apps also push advertisements to users every few seconds.\nFigure 7. Simple Designs Ltd’s data recovery app as it appears on Google Play, and the seemingly legitimate user interface of the appWe’ve found other developers, such as AppTchi and Zaybra, which trick users into thinking that their apps worked as described, while displaying advertisements aggressively.\nTwo apps by these developers, which were uploaded around March and April 2018 and have a total installation count of 11,000, claimed to recover deleted data.\nTo give users the impression that they functioned properly, the apps, which are localized in the Arabic language, used a fake progress bar and a fake notification which were purely aesthetic.\nFigure 8. Zaybra’s image recovery app, whose translated title is “Accurately retrieve deleted pictures and videos in high quality”, used fake progress and notification barsTable 3.\nDetails of the apps whose content fits the description/title on Google Play, but do not provide any real functionality We reported all the apps discussed in this blog to Google in July 2018.\nSome of the apps have been removed, while the rest are still available on the Play Store.\nProtection\nSymantec and Norton products detect these apps as:\nAndroid.Clickads\nMitigation\nStay protected from mobile risks and malware by taking these precautions:\nKeep your software up to date\nDo not download apps from unfamiliar sites\nOnly install apps from trusted sources\nPay close attention to the permissions requested by apps\nInstall a suitable mobile security app, such as Norton or Symantec Endpoint Protection Mobile, to protect your device and data\nMake frequent backups of important data\nFile AttachmentsContents of tables - IOCsTXT10.07\nKBAbout the AuthorMay\nYing TeeSoftware EngineerMay Ying is a member of Symantec’s Security Technology and Response team where she is focused on researching and developing mobile security technologies.\nAbout the AuthorMartin ZhangPrinc Software EngineerMartin is a member of Symantec’s Security Technology and Response team who are focused on providing round-the-clock protection against current and future cyber threats.\nRelated Blog PostsPosted: 15 Nov, 20228 Min ReadBillbug: State-sponsored Actor Targets Cert Authority, Government Agencies in Multiple Asian CountriesPosted: 28 Oct, 20229 Min\nReadCranefly: Threat Actor Uses Previously Unseen Techniques and Tools in Stealthy CampaignPosted: 21 Oct, 20228 Min ReadExbyte: BlackByte Ransomware Attackers Deploy New Exfiltration ToolPosted: 18 Oct, 202210 Min\nReadSpyder Loader: Malware Seen in Recent Campaign Targeting Organizations in Hong Kong SubscribeFollowtwitterlinkedinPrivacy PolicyCookie PolicyData Processing and Data TransfersSupplier ResponsibilityTerms of UseSitemapCopyright © 2005-2022\nBroadcom.",
