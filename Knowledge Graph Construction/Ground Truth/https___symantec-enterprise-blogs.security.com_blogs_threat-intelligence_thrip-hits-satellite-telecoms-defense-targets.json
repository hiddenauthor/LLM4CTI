Targeted Attack Analytics leverages machine learning to spot malicious activity associated with targeted attacks and alerts the customer.\nArmed with this information about the malware and living off the land tactics being used by this group of attackers whom we named Thrip, we broadened our search to see if we could find similar patterns that indicated Thrip had been targeting other organizations.\nWe uncovered a wide-ranging cyber espionage campaign involving powerful malware being used against targets that are a cause for concern.\nWe identified three computers in China being used to launch the Thrip attacks.\nThrip’s motive is likely espionage and its targets include those in the communications, geospatial imaging, and defense sectors, both in the United States and Southeast Asia.\nEye on the sky: Thrip’s targets\nPerhaps the most worrying discovery we made was that Thrip had targeted a satellite communications operator.\nThe attack group seemed to be particularly interested in the operational side of the company, looking for and infecting computers running software that monitors and controls satellites.\nThis suggests to us that Thrip’s motives go beyond spying and may also include disruption.\nAnother target was an organization involved in geospatial imaging and mapping.\nAgain, Thrip seemed to be mainly interested in the operational side of the company.\nIt targeted computers running MapXtreme Geographic Information System (GIS) software which is used for tasks such as developing custom geospatial applications or integrating location-based data into other applications.\nIt also targeted machines running Google Earth Server and Garmin imaging software.\nThe satellite operator wasn’t the only communications target Thrip was interested in.\nThe group had also targeted three different telecoms operators, all based in Southeast Asia.\nIn all cases, based on the nature of the computers infected by Thrip, it appeared that the telecoms companies themselves and not their customers were the targets of these attacks.\nIn addition, there was a fourth target of interest, a defense contractor.\nFigure 2. Thrip, spying on communications, mapping, and defense targetsAttempting to hide in plain sight\nThrip uses a mixture of custom malware and living off the land tools to perform its attacks. The latter include:\nPsExec: Microsoft Sysinternals tool for executing processes on other systems.\nThe tool was primarily used by the attackers to move laterally on the victim’s network.\nPowerShell: Microsoft scripting tool that was used to run commands to download payloads, traverse compromised networks, and carry out reconnaissance.\nMimikatz: Freely available tool capable of changing privileges, exporting security certificates, and recovering Windows passwords in plaintext.\nWinSCP: Open source FTP client used to exfiltrate data from targeted organizations.\nLogMeIn: Cloud-based remote access software.\nIt’s unclear whether the attackers gained unauthorized access to the victim’s LogMeIn accounts or whether they created their own.\nAll of these tools, with the exception of Mimikatz (which is almost always used maliciously), have legitimate uses.\nFor example, PowerShell is widely used within enterprises and the vast majority of scripts are legitimate.\nSimilarly, PsExec is frequently used by systems administrators.\nHowever, in this case, it was Thrip’s use of PsExec that drew our attention.\nThrough advanced artificial intelligence and machine learning, TAA has trained itself to spot patterns of malicious activity.\nWhile PsExec itself may be innocuous, the way that it was being used here triggered an alert by TAA.\nIn short, Thrip’s attempts at camouflage blew its cover.\nWhile Thrip now makes heavy use of living off the land tactics, it also employs custom malware (Infostealer.Catchamas), particularly against computers of interest.\nCatchamas is a custom Trojan designed to steal information from an infected computer and contains additional features designed to avoid detection.\nHighly targeted espionage operation\nFrom the initial alert triggered by TAA, we were able to follow a trail that eventually enabled us to see the bigger picture of a cyber espionage campaign originating from computers within China and targeting multiple organizations in the U.S. and Southeast Asia.\nEspionage is the group’s likely motive but given its interest in compromising operational systems, it could also adopt a more aggressive, disruptive stance should it choose to do so.\nProtection\nThe following protections are in place to protect customers against Thrip attacks:\nFile-based protection\nInfostealer.Catchamas\nHacktool.Mimikatz\nNetwork protection products\nMalware Analysis Appliance detects activity associated with Thrip\nCustomers with Webpulse-enabled products are protected against activity associated with Thrip\nThreat intelligence\nIn addition to file-based protection, customers of the DeepSight Intelligence Managed Adversary and Threat Intelligence (MATI) service have received reports on Thrip, which detail methods of detecting and thwarting activities of this group.\nFile AttachmentsThrip IOC listTXT564 bytesFurther reading\nTo find out more about Targeted Attack Analytics (TAA), read our whitepaper Targeted Attack Analytics: Using Cloud-based Artificial Intelligence for Enterprise-Focused Advanced Threat Protection\nAbout the AuthorThreat Hunter TeamSymantecThe Threat Hunter Team is a group of security experts within Symantec whose mission is to investigate targeted attacks, drive enhanced protection in Symantec products, and offer analysis that helps customers respond to attacks.\nRelated Blog PostsPosted: 15 Nov, 20228 Min ReadBillbug: State-sponsored Actor Targets Cert Authority, Government Agencies in Multiple Asian CountriesPosted: 28 Oct, 20229 Min\nReadCranefly: Threat Actor Uses Previously Unseen Techniques and Tools in Stealthy CampaignPosted: 21 Oct, 20228 Min ReadExbyte: BlackByte Ransomware Attackers Deploy New Exfiltration ToolPosted: 18 Oct, 202210 Min\nReadSpyder Loader: Malware Seen in Recent Campaign Targeting Organizations in Hong Kong SubscribeFollowtwitterlinkedinPrivacy PolicyCookie PolicyData Processing and Data TransfersSupplier ResponsibilityTerms of UseSitemapCopyright © 2005-2022 Broadcom.",
