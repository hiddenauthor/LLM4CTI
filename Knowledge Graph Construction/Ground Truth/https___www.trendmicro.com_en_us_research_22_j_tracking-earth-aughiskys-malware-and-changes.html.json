Some of the builders taken from different samples of Roudan\nFigure 2. Roudan network traffic with encoded MAC addresses\nLuckDLL\nStill unreported, LuckDLL is a relatively new backdoor observed to be active after 2020.\nThe public key is embedded inside the malware configuration and subsequently communicates with the C&C server.\nLuckDLL then proceeds to generate a random session key and initialization vector (IV) to encrypt the traffic.\nThe public key encrypts the session key and IV during initial communication, and shared with the C&C.\nFigure 3. Public key (top) and session key (bottom)\nGrubbyRAT\nFollowing our sensors’ observations, GrubbyRAT is deployed only when Earth Aughisky is interested in important targets that follow certain criteria.\nStill unreported, the configuration file is sometimes installed under an existing application or general system folder and uses the same file name as the component.\nThis suggests that this RAT is installed manually and after the threat actor has gained administrative privileges and control in the infected system.\nFigure 4. Decrypted GrubbyRAT configuration\nTaikite (also known as SVCMONDR)\nWhile previously reported as SVCMONDR, this malware has yet to be attributed to Earth Aughisky.\nPreviously identified with a 2015 report identifying a vulnerability, some samples of this dropped file observed in Taiwan had a .pdb similar to the APT group’s other malware families and tools.\nThe C&C callback traffic is encoded in Base64 and showed a detailed feedback data structure and behavior analysis.\nFigure 5. The Taikite .pdb string\nFigure 6. Taikite traffic\nSiyBot\nThis backdoor has yet to be reported, likely because we observed this tool as being deployed less and only in few attack incidences.\nSiyBot abuses earlier versions of public services such as Gubb and 30 Boxes to perform C&C communication, wherein the necessary credential or token can be found in the malware configuration.\nWe observed this backdoor to support only a few functions based on the commands we found.\nFigure 7. Embedded 30 Boxes credential in the malware\nConnections\nWe feature some of the overlaps and connections we found with Earth Aughisky’s malware and tools.\nRoudan and SiyBot\nWe found the same website being used to host Roudan and SiyBot, as well as ASRWEC downloader (a tool we also attribute to Earth Aughisky) payload in the same repository.\nFigure 8. Roudan (left) and SiyBot (right) payload in the same repository\nRoudan, Taleret, and Taikite\nTaleret is another malware family that has been identified or suspected with Earth Aughisky for years.\nWe found overlaps in the C&C servers being used by these malware families, as well as the same hashes, logging mechanisms, and blog hosts between Taleret and earlier versions of Roudan payload.\nFigure 9. Taleret’s special log file (left) compared with Roudan’s earlier version (right)\nFigure 10. Taleret configuration (left) and Comeon downloader payload (Roudan, right) on the same blog\nInsights\nAs Earth Aughisky is one of the few APT groups that has exercised longevity in cyberespionage, security analysts and teams have collected and continue to gather data to evaluate the group’s skills, developments, relations with other APT groups, and their activities.\nSamples of their malware families and tools allow security teams to gain an understanding of the level of sophistication – or lack of it – of the group’s operations, connection, and even changes possibly affecting them from the real-world complexities such as politics and geographic objectives.\nTo find the complete details of our malware analyses, insights, and attribution connections, download our research paper, “The Rise of Earth Aughisky: Tracking the Campaigns Taidoor Started.”\nIndicators of Compromise (IOCs)\nFor a full list of the IOCs, find them here.\nCyber Crime\nWeb\nICS OT\nAPT & Targeted Attacks\nEndpoints\nNetwork\nCH Lei",
