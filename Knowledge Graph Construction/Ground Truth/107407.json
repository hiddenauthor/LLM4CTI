  "content": "RedLine spreads through ads for cheats and cracks on YouTube | Securelist\nSelf-spreading stealer attacks gamers via YouTube\n15 Sep 2022\nThe bundle: what’s inside beside RedLineConclusionIoC\nOleg Kupreev\nUPD: A notice on Google’s response to the issue was added.\nAn unusual malicious bundle (a collection of malicious programs distributed in the form of a single installation file, self-extracting archive or other file with installer-type functionality) recently caught our eye.\nIts main payload is the widespread RedLine stealer.\nDiscovered in March 2020, RedLine is currently one of the most common Trojans used to steal passwords and credentials from browsers, FTP clients and desktop messengers.\nIt is openly available on underground hacker forums for just a few hundred dollars, a relatively small price tag for malware.\nThe stealer can pinch usernames, passwords, cookies, bank card details and autofill data from Chromium- and Gecko-based browsers, data from cryptowallets, instant messengers and FTP/SSH/VPN clients, as well as files with particular extensions from devices.\nIn addition, RedLine can download and run third-party programs, execute commands in cmd.exe and open links in the default browser.\nThe stealer spreads in various ways, including through malicious spam e-mails and third-party loaders.\nThe bundle: what’s inside beside RedLine\nIn addition to the payload itself, the discovered bundle is of note for its self-propagation functionality.\nSeveral files are responsible for this, which receive videos, and post them to the infected users’ YouTube channels along with the links to a password-protected archive with the bundle in the description.\nThe videos advertise cheats and cracks and provide instructions on hacking popular games and software.\nAmong the games mentioned are APB Reloaded, CrossFire, DayZ, Dying Light 2, F1® 22, Farming Simulator, Farthest Frontier, FIFA 22, Final Fantasy XIV, Forza, Lego Star Wars, Osu!, Point Blank, Project Zomboid, Rust, Sniper Elite, Spider-Man, Stray, Thymesia, VRChat and Walken.\nAccording to Google, the hacked channels were quickly terminated for violation of the company’s Community Guidelines.\nExamples of videos spreading the bundle\nThe original bundle is a self-extracting RAR archive containing a number of malicious files, clean utilities and a script to automatically run the unpacked contents.\nBecause of the expletives used by the bundle’s creators, we had to hide some file names.\nContents of the self-extracting archive\nRight after unpacking, three executable files are run: cool.exe, ***.exe and AutoRun.exe.\nThe first is the RedLine stealer mentioned above.\nThe second is a miner, which makes sense, since the main target audience, judging by the video, is gamers — who are likely to have video cards installed that can be used for mining.\nThe third executable file copies itself to the %APPDATA%\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Start Menu\\Programs\\Startup directory, which ensures automatic startup and runs the first of the batch files.\nThe batch files, in turn, run three other malicious files: MakiseKurisu.exe, download.exe and upload.exe.\nThese are the files responsible for the bundle’s self-distribution.\nOn top of that, one of the batch files runs the nir.exe utility, which lets malicious executable files run without displaying any windows or taskbar icons.\nContents of the first and second batch files\nThe size of the download.exe file is an impressive 35 MB.\nHowever, it’s basically a regular loader whose purpose is to download videos for uploading to YouTube, as well as files with the description text and links to the malicious archive.\nThe executable file is large because it is a NodeJS interpreter glued together with the scripts and dependencies of the main application.\nThe malware takes the file download links from a GitHub repository.\nIn the latest modifications, a 7-Zip archive with videos and descriptions organized into directories is downloaded.\nThe archive is unpacked using the console version of 7-Zip, included in the bundle.\nContents of the 7-Zip archive\nMakiseKurisu.exe is a password stealer written in C# and modified to suit the needs of the bundle’s creators.\nThe source code from GitHub was likely taken as the basis: the file contains many standard stealer features that are not used in any way.\nThese include checking for a debugger and for a virtual environment, sending information about the infected system to instant messengers, and stealing passwords.\nSo, what remains and what do the changes amount to?\nThe only working function in MakiseKurisu.exe is extracting cookies from browsers and storing them in a separate file without sending the stolen data anywhere.\nIt is precisely through cookies that the bundle gains access to the infected user’s YouTube account, where it uploads the video.\nThe last malicious file in the bundle is upload.exe, which uploads the video previously downloaded using download.exe, to YouTube.\nThis file is also written in NodeJS.\nIt uses the Puppeteer Node library, which provides a high-level API for managing Chrome and Microsoft Edge using the DevTools protocol.\nWhen the video is successfully uploaded to YouTube, upload.exe sends a message to Discord with a link to the uploaded video.\nCode for video

cyberthreats, stealer-type malware is often distributed under the guise of game hacks, cheats and cracks.\nThe self-spreading bundle with RedLine is a prime example of this: cybercriminals lure victims with ads for cracks and cheats, as well as instructions on how to hack games.\nAt the same time, the self-propagation functionality is implemented using relatively unsophisticated software, such as a customized open-source stealer.\nAll this is further proof, if any were needed, that illegal software should be treated with extreme caution.\nIoC\nMD5
