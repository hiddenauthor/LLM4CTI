    "###Main Topic:Actors and Identities###\n",
    "Name:'user-account'\n",
    "Definition:Represents a user account that can be used to log in and access system resources.\n",
    "Note:This object is used to describe account information involved in an attack. Its key properties include the user ID (e.g., SID for Windows or UID for Linux), login name, and display name. This object can represent both human user accounts (e.g., 'user123') and system or service accounts (e.g., 'SYSTEM' or 'root'), which is crucial for analyzing attack behaviors like privilege escalation and lateral movement.\n",
    "Example:NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM\n",
    "\n",
    "Name:'identity'\n",
    "Definition:An entity that represents a person, organization, or group.\n",
    "Note:This is a broad category for any formally identified entity. It must be distinguished from 'threat-actor-or-intrusion-set'. An 'identity' can be a victim, a reporting party, a researcher, or a benign company. Only when an 'identity' is determined to be malicious should it be classified as a 'threat-actor-or-intrusion-set'.\n",
    "Example:Google Threat Analysis Group, FireEye\n",
    "\n",
    "Name:'threat-actor-or-intrusion-set'\n",
    "Definition:A combined entity that can represent an individual, group, or organization conducting cyberattacks (i.e., a 'Threat Actor'), or a set of attack activities with common goals, tactics, and infrastructure (i.e., an 'Intrusion Set').\n",
    "Note:This type merges the attacker itself with its cluster of activity. When a threat actor has a clear name (e.g., APT28), use its name directly. If there is no clear name, but its activity can be identified by the tool or malware used, uniformly use the format 'Attacker(using: CVE-2021-44228)'.\n",
    "Example:APT28, Sandworm Team, Attacker(using: CVE-2021-44228)\n",
    "\n",
    "###Main Topic:Malicious Code and Tools###\n",
    "Name:'detailed-part-of-malware-or-hackertool'\n",
    "Definition:A specific component, function, module, or configuration block that is an integral part of a 'malware' or 'hacker-tool'.\n",
    "Note:This describes the internal, often custom-built, workings of malicious software. It is the component-level counterpart to 'malware' and 'hacker-tool'. For components of legitimate software, use 'detailed-part-of-general-software'.\n",
    "Example:The EternalBlue exploit module in WannaCry; a specific function named keylog_routine().\n",
    "\n",
    "Name:'malware'\n",
    "Definition:Software designed to be executed on a victim's system to cause harm, steal data, or establish unauthorized control. It functions as the malicious payload or \"ammunition\" in an attack.\n",
    "Note:This entity represents the part of the attack that runs within the victim's environment, often automatically or silently. While some systems (like RATs) have components of both, 'malware' specifically refers to the client-side agent. Examples include ransomware (WannaCry), trojans (Emotet), and spyware (Agent Tesla).\n",
    "Example: WannaCry, Emotet, Agent Tesla\n",
    "\n",
    "Name:'hacker-tool'\n",
    "Definition:Software used by an attacker or security professional to orchestrate, control, or facilitate a cyberattack. It functions as the \"workbench\" or \"control panel\" for the operation.\n",
    "Note:This entity represents the part of the attack that typically runs within the attacker's environment. It is often interactive and used to create payloads, manage infrastructure, or control malware on victim systems. For the server/control component of a RAT, this type should be used. Examples include exploitation frameworks (Metasploit), C2 platforms (Cobalt Strike), and network scanners (Nmap). Only the name should be used.\n",
    "Example: Cobalt Strike, Metasploit Framework, Mimikatz.\n",
    "\n",
    "###Main Topic:Legitimate Software###\n",
    "Name:'detailed-part-of-general-software'\n",
    "Definition:A specific component, function, library, or command that is part of a 'general-software' entity and is being leveraged in a malicious context.\n",
    "Note:This allows for a granular description of how legitimate software is abused. It is the component-level counterpart to 'general-software'.\n",
    "Example:The Invoke-Expression cmdlet in PowerShell; the CreateRemoteThread Windows API function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Name:'general-software'\n",
    "Definition:Legitimate software with a non-malicious primary purpose that is either exploited as a target of an attack (e.g., via a vulnerability), serves as a host for malicious code, or is abused by threat actors to facilitate an attack.\n",
    "Note:This is the counterpart to 'hacker-tool' and is central to Living off the Land (LotL) attacks. For its specific components, use 'detailed-part-of-general-software'.\n",
    "Example: Microsoft Office, PowerShell, curl, OpenSSH\n",
    "\n",
    "###Main Topic:Attack Actions and Campaigns###\n",
    "Name:'vulnerability'\n",
    "Definition:A flaw or weakness in software, hardware, or procedure that a threat actor can exploit to cause harm.\n",
    "Note:This entity represents the weakness itself, not the act of exploiting it. An 'attack-pattern' is what 'exploits' a 'vulnerability'. It is most often identified by a formal tracking number like a CVE identifier.\n",
    "Example:CVE-2021-44228\n",
    "\n",
    "Name:'attack-pattern'\n",
    "Definition:A specific attack method or technique described verbatim in the source text that an adversary uses to achieve a malicious objective.\n",
    "Note:Indicates the exact attack method or technique mentioned in the source text, without mapping to any predefined TTP framework identifiers; retains the terminology used by the original author.\n",
    "Example:Phishing email delivery, SQL injection attempt, Brute-force login operation\n",
    "\n",
    "Name:'campaign'\n",
    "Definition:Refers to a series of attack actions with specific objectives and a timeframe, typically launched by one or more threat actors to achieve a strategic goal.\n",
    "Note:A campaign usually has a well-known name (e.g., 'Operation Shady RAT'). If an attack campaign does not have a formal or known name, but can be referred to by the key tool or malware it uses, the format 'Attacking(using: CVE-2021-44228)' should be used. \n",
    "Example:Operation Shady RAT, Attacking(using: CVE-2021-44228)\n",
    "\n",
    "###Main Topic:Host-based Observables###\n",
    "Name:'windows-registry-key'\n",
    "Definition:Represents a key in the Windows Registry, which is a hierarchical database used for storing settings for the operating system and applications.\n",
    "Note:The registry key is critical for analyzing malicious activity on Windows systems. Malware often achieves persistence, stores configuration, or disables security software by modifying or creating registry keys. The key properties of this object include the hive, the key path, and one or more values contained within the key, each of which has a name, data, and type.\n",
    "Example:HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run\n",
    "\n",
    "Name:'process'\n",
    "Definition:An instance of a computer program that is being executed. It contains all the state information of the program at runtime.\n",
    "Note:This is a core object for host-based analysis. Its key properties include the Process ID (PID), the process name (typically the executable file path), its command-line arguments, and a reference to its parent process (parent_ref). By analyzing processes and their parent-child relationships, a clear execution chain can be constructed, such as a Word document process launching a PowerShell process.\n",
    "Example:powershell.exe:3104\n",
    "\n",
    "Name:'file'\n",
    "Definition:A computer file, which is a resource for storing information in a computer system.\n",
    "Note:This entity should be distinguished from 'malware'. A 'file' is the technical object (a sequence of bytes with a name and path), while 'malware' is a classification of that file's malicious purpose. Any 'malware' entity is represented by a 'file' object, but not all 'file' objects are malware (e.g., a benign document targeted by an exploit). It is also different from a 'process', which is the running instance of a file.\n",
    "Example:C:\\Windows\\System32\\ntdll.dll\n",
    "\n",
    "###Main Topic:Network Observables and Infrastructure###\n",
    "Name:'url'\n",
    "Definition:A Uniform Resource Locator, providing a complete, specific address for a resource on the World Wide Web.\n",
    "Note:The key distinction is with 'domain-name'. A URL is more specific, containing the scheme (e.g., http, ftp), the domain, and often a port, path, and query string. Many different URLs can exist on a single domain.\n",
    "Example:http://phishing-site.com/login.php?user=victim\n",
    "\n",
    "Name:'domain-name'\n",
    "Definition:A human-readable name that corresponds to a network resource, typically an IP address, as part of the Domain Name System (DNS).\n",
    "Note:This entity should be distinguished from a 'url'. A 'domain-name' is only the host part (e.g., example.com), while a 'url' is the full address including the protocol and path (e.g., https://example.com/login). It is also distinct from the IP address(es) it 'resolves-to'.\n",
    "Example:evil-c2-server.net\n",
    "\n",
    "Name:'ipv4-addr'\n",
    "Definition:An Internet Protocol version 4 (IPv4) address, which is a numerical label assigned to each device participating in a computer network that uses the Internet Protocol for communication.\n",
    "Note:This is a fundamental network observable. It must be distinguished from a 'mac-address' (Layer 3 logical address vs. Layer 2 physical address) and a 'domain-name' (machine-routable address vs. human-readable name). An IP address by itself is just an observable; it only becomes an 'indicator' when context about its maliciousness is added.\n",
    "Example:198.51.100.10\n",
    "\n",
    "Name:'ipv6-addr'\n",
    "Definition:An Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6) address, representing a logical network address for modern internet protocols.\n",
    "Note:Functionally similar to 'ipv4-addr' but with a much larger address space. All distinctions that apply to 'ipv4-addr' (e.g., vs. 'mac-address' or 'domain-name') also apply here.\n",
    "Example:2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334\n",
    "\n",
    "Name:'network-traffic'\n",
    "Definition:Represents an aggregation of network traffic that flows between two or more network endpoints. It can be a single connection or a series of related network packets.\n",
    "Note:This object does not represent a single packet but describes a \"flow\". It uses references to other objects to fully define this flow, such as source and destination IP addresses (src_ref, dst_ref), source and destination ports (src_port, dst_port), and the protocols used (protocols). It is often used to describe network-level activities like C2 communications, data exfiltration, or network scanning. In a graph, a traffic node is often named using a 5-tuple.\n",
    "Example:tcp:192.168.1.100:51234-203.0.113.10:443\n",
    "\n",
    "Name:'mac-address'\n",
    "Definition:Refers to the Media Access Control Address, a unique physical address assigned to a network interface controller (NIC) for communication at the data link layer.\n",
    "Note:A MAC address is typically a 48-bit address, represented as six groups of hexadecimal digits separated by colons or hyphens. It operates at Layer 2 (Data Link Layer) of the OSI model, which is different from an IP address that operates at Layer 3 (Network Layer). An IP address is a logical address that can be changed, while a MAC address is a physical address burned into the hardware. It is used to deliver data frames to the correct device on a local network.\n",
    "Example:00:1A:2B:3C:4D:5E\n",
    "\n",
    "Name:'email-address'\n",
    "Definition:A specific address used to send and receive electronic mail messages.\n",
    "Note:This is a fundamental observable object. It is a key component in phishing 'attack-patterns' and can be associated with an 'identity' or used as a login for a 'user-account'.\n",
    "Example:phisher@example.com\n",
    "\n",
    "Name:'infrastructure'\n",
    "Definition:Hardware or software resources used to facilitate an activity, particularly an attack.\n",
    "Note:This is a generic, fallback category. As per its original definition, if a more specific type like 'url', 'ipv4-addr', or 'domain-name' can be used, it should be preferred. 'infrastructure' is for cases where the type is ambiguous or is a higher-level concept (e.g., describing \"the attacker's C2 network\" as a whole).\n",
    "Example:Attacker C2 Server\n",
    "\n",
    "###Main Topic:Data and Credentials###\n",
    "Name:'credential-value'\n",
    "Definition:A piece of secret information used for authentication, such as a password, access token, or API key.\n",
    "Note:This is a specific data type, distinct from 'user-account', which represents the account entity itself. For security reasons, the actual secret value should rarely be stored directly; this entity often represents the existence or type of credential that was compromised.\n",
    "Example:Stolen Kerberos Ticket\n",
    "\n",
    "Name:'x509-certificate'\n",
    "Definition:Refers to a digital certificate that conforms to the X.509 standard, which verifies the authenticity of a public key by binding it to an identity (such as an individual, an organization, or a domain name).\n",
    "Note:This object is very important when describing cybersecurity incidents, especially in TLS/SSL encrypted communications and code signing. Attackers may use self-signed, stolen, or forged certificates to encrypt C2 communications or to make malware appear legitimate. Its key properties include the issuer, subject, serial number, and various hashes of the certificate (e.g., SHA-1, SHA-256). The hash is often used as the unique identifier for the node.\n",
    "Example:50D4583B1B35391AA89E86148B267974937447BF\n",
    "\n",
    "###Main Topic:Intelligence, Defense, and Analysis###\n",
    "Name:'indicator'\n",
    "Definition:A pattern of observables or properties that signifies malicious or suspicious activity, serving as a forensic or detection artifact.\n",
    "Note:An indicator is not the raw data itself, but rather an analytical conclusion or pattern derived from it. It's a critical distinction: An IP address is just an 'ipv4-addr' observable; that same IP address, when known to be malicious and packaged with context (e.g., \"C2 server for Emotet\"), becomes an 'indicator'. It's the bridge between raw data and actionable intelligence.\n",
    "Example:[file:hashes.'MD5' = 'd41d8cd98f00b204e9800998ecf8427e']\n",
    "\n",
    "Name:'course-of-action'\n",
    "Definition:A recommended step or set of steps to mitigate a threat or remediate an incident.\n",
    "Note:This entity represents a recommended defensive action, not a technical object itself. It is the answer to \"What should we do about this threat?\". It is the direct counterpoint to an 'attack-pattern', and is often linked to a threat via the 'mitigates' relationship.\n",
    "Example:Apply patch for CVE-2021-44228\n",
    "\n",
    "Name:'security-product'\n",
    "Definition:A commercial or open-source software, hardware, platform, or service designed to provide cybersecurity functions.\n",
    "Note:This should be distinguished from 'hacker-tool' (which is typically offensive) and 'general-software' (whose primary purpose is not security). Some tools, like network analyzers, can be dual-use, but are categorized here when used for defense.\n",
    "Example:CrowdStrike Falcon\n",
    "\n",
    "Name:'malware-analysis-document-or-publication-or-conference'\n",
    "Definition:A specifically named or titled source of cybersecurity information, which can be a specific document, a formal publication, or an event.\n",
    "Note:The key characteristic of this type is that the entity must have a specific, unique name or title. This rule is what distinguishes it from a 'generic-noun' like \"Threat Report\". For example, \"Mandiant APT1 Report\" is a specific instance and belongs here, while the term \"Threat Report\" itself is a 'generic-noun'. Intelligence is often derived from or 'based-on' entities of this type.\n",
    "Example: 'Mandiant APT1 Report','Kaspersky Lab's \"Operation Aurora\" White Paper',\n",
    "\n",
    "###Main Topic:Geographic and Contextual Information###\n",
    "Name:'location'\n",
    "Definition:A geographical location, which can range from a country to a specific street address.\n",
    "Note:This entity is used to provide geographical context to other entities. It can be linked to a 'threat-actor-or-intrusion-set' via the 'originates-from' relationship or to an 'infrastructure' object via the 'located-at' relationship to specify its physical presence.\n",
    "Example:Beijing, China\n",
    "\n",
    "###Main Topic:Abstract and Fallback Categories###\n",
    "Name:'abstract-concept'\n",
    "Definition:Describes high-level, typically uncountable, ideas, fields of study, principles, or broad categories of activity that do not represent a specific, individual entity.\n",
    "Note:This type is specifically for uncountable nouns that represent broad ideas. It serves as a high-level fallback category, following the priority: a specific entity type (e.g., 'malware') -> 'abstract-concept' -> 'other' -> 'noise'. This distinguishes abstract ideas from both concrete entities and countable categories of things ('generic-noun').\n",
    "Example:Cyber Crime, Ransomware Ecosystem, Incident Response, Geopolitics.\n",
    "\n",
    "Name:'generic-noun'\n",
    "Definition:A term that refers to a class or type of entity, typically a countable noun, rather than a specific, named instance of that entity.\n",
    "Note:This type is specifically for countable nouns that represent a class of objects. It helps differentiate between the name of a category and a specific member of that category. It functions within the classification fallback hierarchy: a specific entity type (e.g., 'malware') -> 'generic-noun' -> 'other'-> 'noise'.\n",
    "Example:Threat Report (as a word), white paper (as a word), Malware (as a word), Vulnerability (as a word).\n",
    "\n",
    "Name:'other'\n",
    "Definition:Any other valid entities related to cyber threats that do not fit into any of the other defined categories.\n",
    "Note:This category functions as a catch-all for meaningful data that is currently unclassifiable. It serves as a source for identifying potential new entity types as the classification schema evolves.\n",
    "Example:Anti-Ransomware Day, MITRE ATT&CK\n",
    "\n",
    "Name:'noise'\n",
    "Definition:Data that is unidentifiable, incorrectly formatted, nonsensical, or otherwise irrelevant junk.\n",
    "Note:This type is used to flag and isolate poor quality or corrupted data, preventing it from polluting analysis. It is the final classification for data that has no informational value.\n",
    "Example:'quality#@!', ' (9/1718) [Japanese]'.\n",
    "'''\n",
    "\n",
    "rel_type_definition='''\n",
    "###Main Topic:Attack and Compromise Relationships###\n",
    "Name:'exploits'\n",
    "Definition:Represents an entity leveraging a specific flaw or weakness within another entity (typically a Vulnerability) to achieve a malicious objective.\n",
    "Note:This is a more specific form of 'uses'. When the action involves taking advantage of a known vulnerability, 'exploits' should be used instead of 'uses'.\n",
    "Example:The malware exploits the CVE-2021-44228 vulnerability.\n",
    "\n",
    "Name:'bypasses'\n",
    "Definition:Indicates that an offensive entity (e.g., malware, exploit) successfully evades or circumvents a defensive measure. If 'mitigates' (such as patching to mitigate vulnerabilities) are successful actions for defenders, then 'bypasses' (such as using obfuscation techniques to bypass sandboxes) are successful actions for attackers. It is specifically used to describe the behavior of circumventing and bypassing defensive measures.\n",
    "Example:The malware's obfuscation technique bypasses sandbox analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Name:'malicious-investigates-track-detects'\n",
    "Definition:Represents a malicious action where one entity (typically malware or a tool) performs either a discrete investigation, continuous tracking, or active detection of another entity to gather information or for evasive purposes.\n",
    "Note:This relationship now covers three types of malicious information gathering and reconnaissance: Investigating: One-time reconnaissance of an entity (e.g., a system scan). Tracking: Long-term, continuous surveillance of an entity (e.g., keystroke logging). Detecting (Malicious): Evasion-focused discovery, such as identifying a sandbox, debugger, or specific security tool to alter behavior.\n",
    "Example:Example 1 (Investigates): A malware implant malicious-investigates-track-detects local system configuration files. Example 2 (Tracks): A spyware module malicious-investigates-track-detects the user's web Browse history. Example 3 (Detecting): The malware malicious-investigates-track-detects the presence of a virtual machine environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Name:'impersonates'\n",
    "Definition:Indicates that one entity actively masquerades as another, distinct entity to deceive or gain trust.\n",
    "Note:This is distinct from 'alias-of'. 'impersonates' is a deceptive action between two separate entities. In contrast, 'alias-of' links two different names for the very same entity. For example, a hacker 'impersonates' the CEO in an email, whereas \"APT28\" is an 'alias-of' \"Fancy Bear.\"\n",
    "Example:A threat actor impersonates a trusted IT administrator to trick users.\n",
    "\n",
    "Name:'targets'\n",
    "Definition:Describes an offensive entity directing its actions against another entity. It expresses the intent and direction of an attack.\n",
    "Note:'targets' describes intent, while 'compromises' describes a successful outcome. An actor might 'target' the financial industry for years but 'compromise' a specific bank in a single operation. 'targets' is also broader than 'exploits'; an actor can 'target' an organization, whereas they 'exploit' a specific vulnerability within that organization's systems.\n",
    "Example:A phishing campaign targets employees in the financial sector.\n",
    "\n",
    "Name:'compromises'\n",
    "Definition:Represents that an offensive entity has successfully violated the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of a target, achieving some form of unauthorized access or control.\n",
    "Note:See the note under 'targets' for a direct comparison.\n",
    "Example:The threat actor compromised the company's domain controller.\n",
    "\n",
    "Name:'leads-to'\n",
    "Definition:Describes a causal relationship where one entity or event directly results in another outcome or state, often used in attack chains. Relationships such as 'exploits', 'delivers', and 'executes' are all “points” in the attack chain, and 'leads-to' is the “line” connecting these points, clearly showing the logic of “vulnerability exploit leads to remote code execution”. When a relationship meets the subdivision relationship of 'exploits', 'delivers', and 'executes', choose them instead of 'leads-to'.\n",
    "Example:Exploitation of a vulnerability leads-to remote code execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "###Main Topic:Data and Payload Movement###\n",
    "Name:'drops'\n",
    "Definition:Represents an entity creating a new file on the local filesystem from its own embedded or internal resources.\n",
    "Note:This relationship exclusively describes the action of Local -> Local file creation, with no network communication involved. This is distinct from 'downloads', which is an External -> Local action.\n",
    "Example:The installer drops a malicious DLL file into the System32 folder.\n",
    "\n",
    "Name:'downloads'\n",
    "Definition:Represents an entity retrieving a file or data from an external, remote source and saving it to the local system.\n",
    "Note:This relationship exclusively describes the action of External -> Local data transfer. It is the direct opposite of 'drops', which involves no network communication.\n",
    "Example:The dropper downloads a second-stage payload from a malicious URL.\n",
    "\n",
    "Name:'executes'\n",
    "Definition:Signifies that one entity (e.g., a loader, script) runs or initiates another entity (e.g., a malicious executable).\n",
    "Example:A dropper executes a second-stage payload.\n",
    "\n",
    "Name:'delivers'\n",
    "Definition:Represents a higher-level, abstract relationship where one attack component is responsible for 'bringing' a malicious payload or tool to the target environment.\n",
    "Note:This describes the abstract \"bringing\" action within an attack chain, answering \"How did the payload get here?\" at a tactical level. For example, a phishing email 'delivers' malware; this delivery might be achieved through the user 'downloads' an attachment, which then 'drops' an executable.\n",
    "Example:A phishing campaign delivers the Ursnif malware.\n",
    "\n",
    "Name:'beacons-to'\n",
    "Definition:Specifically indicates that malware or an implant periodically sends 'beacon' or 'heartbeat' signals to its Command and Control (C2) server.\n",
    "Example:Malware beacons-to (beacons-to) Command and Control URL.\n",
    "\n",
    "Name:'exfiltrate-to'\n",
    "Definition:Specifically describes the act of stealing data from a compromised system and transmitting it outward to a target location specified by the attacker, such as a server or IP address.\n",
    "Note:The core of this relationship is purposeful, outbound data transmission. Its distinction from other network relationships lies in intent and direction: (1) Versus 'communicates-with': 'exfiltrate-to' is a specific type of 'communicates-with'. If the purpose of the communication is confirmed to be data theft, 'exfiltrate-to' should be preferred for more precise semantics. If the purpose is unknown, the more general 'communicates-with' should be used. (2) Versus 'downloads': The data flow direction is the opposite of 'downloads'. 'downloads' refers to fetching files from an external source into the victim system, while 'exfiltrate-to' refers to uploading data from the victim system to an external source. (3) Versus 'leaks': 'exfiltrate-to' typically describes a targeted, covert transfer from a victim to an attacker. In contrast, 'leaks' (if used as a custom relationship) usually refers to a broader, potentially public or semi-public data disclosure.\n",
    "Example:A spyware implant (Malware) exfiltrate-to a specific FTP server (Infrastructure) to upload stolen documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "Name:'leaks'\n",
    "Definition:Represents the unauthorized disclosure or public release of sensitive resources. This includes confidential data (e.g., documents, credentials) as well as operational assets like malware source code or vulnerability details. \n",
    "Note:'exfiltrate-to' (malware steals data to a server) describes the directed transfer of data from the victim to the attacker. 'leaks' (internal threat actors leak company documents) describes the unauthorized public or semi-public disclosure of sensitive resources (data, source code, etc.). The core difference between the two lies in the direction of information flow and the degree of disclosure.\n",
    "Example:An insider threat leaks confidential corporate documents online. The source code for a prominent banking trojan leaks onto a public repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "Name:'communicates-with'\n",
    "Definition:Describes the occurrence of network communication between two entities. It is a general relationship for network interactions.\n",

It has key distinctions from other relationships: (1) Versus 'attributed-to': 'authored-by' focuses on the act of creation itself, while 'attributed-to' focuses on assigning responsibility for an attack campaign. An organization can have 'authored-by' a tool, while the campaign that uses the tool is 'attributed-to' another group. (2) Versus 'owns': 'owns' describes the state of ownership over infrastructure or tools, while 'authored-by' describes their creation source.\n",

    "Note:The core of this relationship is ownership by a real-world entity. Its distinction from 'controls' lies in the nature of the subject: the subject of 'owns' is a real-world entity (a team, an individual), while the subject of 'controls' is software. This is a critical distinction as it separates the real-world actor from their digital-world proxy tools.\n",

    "Note:The core of this relationship is software-level control. Its key distinction from 'owns' is the level of the controller: the subject of 'controls' is a piece of software (e.g., a RAT), while the subject of 'owns' is a real-world entity (e.g., a team). For example, a team can 'own' a domain name, and the RAT program on the C2 server pointed to by that domain then 'controls' another process on the victim host.\n",

    "Note:It differs from 'authored-by' and 'affiliated-with'. 'attributed-to' focuses on the responsibility for an attack, while 'authored-by' pertains to the creation of an entity, like malware. An organization might 'author' a tool, but if another affiliated group uses it in an attack, the attack activity is 'attributed-to' the latter. 'affiliated-with' describes a broader organizational or social connection (e.g., membership, employment), whereas 'attributed-to' is a specific assignment of culpability for an action.\n",
    "Example:Intrusion Set \"Sandworm\" is attributed-to Russian GRU Unit 74455.\n",
    "\n",
    "Name:'affiliated-with'\n",
    "Definition:Describes an affiliation, employment, or membership relationship between individuals and organizations. 'authored-by' refers to the creation relationship, 'attributed-to' refers to the responsibility for the attack, and 'owns' refers to the ownership of the infrastructure. 'affiliated-with' describes an 'affiliation' relationship at the organizational or social level, which is not necessarily creation, attack or ownership. When a relationship meets the subdivision relationship of 'attributed-to' and 'owns', choose them instead of 'affiliated-with'.\n",

    "Name:'has'\n",
    "Definition:Indicates that an entity possesses a specific feature, function, or capability, which may be abstract in nature.\n",
    "Note:This relationship is best used for attributing characteristics or functions to an object. It differs from 'consists-of', which is used for deconstructing an object into its physical or logical components.

    "Name:'depends-on'\n",
    "Definition:Signifies that one entity requires another entity to exist or function correctly.\n",
    "Note:This describes a state of prerequisite or dependency. It differs from uses, which describes an action. For example, malware uses PowerShell to execute commands, but it depends-on a specific library to run. It covers terms like requires and is required for.\n",

It covers terms like create, creates, and generates. If the relationship is more concise, such as a malware creating a file, use 'drops' instead, or if it is about the original creation by an identity, use 'authored-by'. Otherwise, use 'creates-or-generates' to capture the action of creation or generation in a broader sense.\n",

    "Name:'uses'\n",
    "Definition:Represents that an entity employs or leverages another entity to achieve its objectives. It is a highly general, active relationship describing \"A uses B to do something.\"\n",
    "Note:Differentiated from 'depends-on' and 'exploits'. 'uses' is an active behavior (e.g., malware uses PowerShell to execute commands), while 'depends-on' is a static, prerequisite state (e.g., the malware's execution depends-on the .NET Framework). 'exploits' is a special case of 'uses' that specifically involves leveraging a 'vulnerability'; if a vulnerability is leveraged, 'exploits' should be preferred.\n",

'derived-from' is more abstract, signifying conceptual or technical inspiration without direct code reuse. 'compares-to' is for a general comparison of attributes without implying any lineage.\n",
    "Example:The Gootkit malware is a variant-of the earlier Gozi trojan.\n",

    "\n",
    "Name:'compares-to'\n",
    "Definition:Indicates a comparative relationship between two entities based on their features, behavior, complexity, or other attributes. 'variant-of' means two entities have a direct evolution or code-derived variant relationship, while 'compares-to' is broader and can include any form of comparison. When a relationship meets both criteria, 'variant-of' should be used instead.\n",
    "Example:Malware A compares-to Malware B in its propagation method.\n",
    "\n",
    "Name:'categorized-as'\n",
    "Definition:Links an entity to its formal classification or type within a given taxonomy. 'variant-of' is a specific evolutionary classification. 'categorized-as' is a more formal, ontological classification relationship, for example, used to link an instance to a category in a taxonomy.\n",

    "Note:The core of this relationship is analytical inference. It is distinct from the 'detecting' function within other relationships (e.g., 'research-describes-analysis-of-characterizes-detects'). The 'detecting' function represents an active, confirmed discovery, whereas 'indicates' represents a probabilistic link (\"this likely means that\"). This relationship is fundamental for operationalizing threat intelligence, as it directly connects a detectable artifact (the IOC) to the threat it helps to identify.\n",

    "    In cyber threat intelligence, 'entity' refers to any unit of information that can be independently identified, described, and analyzed, and it forms a fundamental component of each link in threat activity. It is important to note that entities here are not limited to those verified indicators (IOCs) specifically used for detection, such as specific IP addresses, domain names, or file hashes, but a broader concept. Entities can be objects with clear names and characteristics (such as 'get-logon-history.ps1'), or data objects such as 'RAR file', even if it has no fixed naming rules.\n",

    "\n",
    "        Contextual significance: Even if an entity (such as a downloaded 'RAR file') does not have a specific name, as long as it has contextual significance and analytical value in threat intelligence analysis, it is still a valid entity.\n",

Before your work, a single article was split into multiple chunks, and each chunk has gone through entity and relationship extraction. Now, you need to merge the processing results of these chunks to form a complete knowledge graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your core task: Please merge the results of multiple chunks according to the following strict rules:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Merging Rules\n",
    "1. Entity Merging:\n",
    "    - Consider two entities the same if either:\n",
    "      a) Their names are identical or semantically equivalent (including case differences).\n",
    "    - Merging Strategy:\n",
    "      * Keep the simplest naming format (e.g., 'APT28' and 'APT28 (Fancy Bear)' merge into the former, while 'APT28' adds an attribute `'alias': ['Fancy Bear']`), and add a relationship:\n",
    "        `'sub': 'APT28', 'rel': 'variant of', 'rel_type': ['variant-of'], 'obj': 'Fancy Bear'`.\n",
    "      * Merge all alias lists (removing duplicates).\n",
    "      * Merge all mother entity relationships (keep the most complete evolution chain).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Relationship Merging:\n",
    "    - Only merge relationships if all the following conditions are met:\n",
    "      a) The subject (sub) is the same after entity merging.\n",
    "      b) The object (obj) is the same after entity merging.\n",
    "      c) The relationship description (rel) is exactly the same text.\n",
    "      d) Differences in 'rel_type' are ignored for the merging condition.\n",
    "    - Merging Strategy:\n",
    "      * Relationships with different rel_type remain as separate entries or, if merged, preserve their union.\n",
    "      * Maintain the complete original relationship description.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Special Handling:\n",
    "    - Only perform merging; all unique entities and relationships must be retained.\n",
    "    - Cross-chunk implied relationships (inferred through mother entities) must be explicitly created.\n",
    "    - Ensure the final result contains all original information, only eliminating redundant expressions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Output Requirements\n",
    "Maintain the same JSON structure as the original, but:\n",
    "1. Streamline the entity list according to the merging rules.\n",
    "2. Streamline the relationship list according to the merging rules.\n",
    "3. Retain all aliases and mother entity relationships.\n",
    "4. Keep all distinct relationship descriptions.\n",
    "5. The rel_type field should preserve all unique values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Please strictly output the final merged results in the following format:\n",
