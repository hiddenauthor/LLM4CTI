# Question Answering Based on Knowledge Graph

This module evaluates whether knowledge graphs extracted by LLM4CTI can help large language models (LLMs) answer CTI-related multiple-choice questions more accurately.


## ðŸ”„ Workflow

### 1. Input Preparation
- Load `RQ1 Evaluation.xlsx`, which includes:
  - CTI article text
  - Extracted knowledge graphs from different methods (LLM4CTI, CTIKG, GPT-4o)
  - Topic entity for each article
  - Ground truth article label (`article type`)

### 2. Question Generation
- Use LLM prompts to generate **10 entity-centric, multiple-choice questions per article**.
- Questions include 4 options (A/B/C/D) and are stored as JSON.

### 3. Prompt-Based Answering
- For each question, create a prompt:  
  > "The article or knowledge graph is provided below. Here is the question..."

### 4. Answer Evaluation
- Compare LLM answers with ground truth (A/B/C/D).
- Compute accuracy grouped by:
  - Method
  - Threat category (e.g., APT, Adware, Trojan)

### RQ2: Question Answering

We assess how well LLM4CTIâ€™s knowledge graphs support downstream question answering by LLMs. The evaluation is based on multiple-choice questions generated from CTI articles.
