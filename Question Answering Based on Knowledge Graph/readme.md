# Question Answering Based on Knowledge Graph

This module evaluates whether knowledge graphs extracted by LLM4CTI can help large language models (LLMs) answer CTI-related multiple-choice questions more accurately.


## ðŸ”„ Workflow

### 1. Input Preparation
- Load `RQ1 Evaluation.xlsx`, which includes:
  - CTI article text
  - Extracted knowledge graphs from different methods (LLM4CTI, CTIKG, GPT-4o)
  - Topic entity for each article
  - Ground truth article label (`article type`)

### 2. Question Generation
- Use LLM prompts to generate **10 entity-centric, multiple-choice questions per article**.
- Questions include 4 options (A/B/C/D) and are stored as JSON.

### 3. Prompt-Based Answering
- For each question, create a prompt:  
  > "The article or knowledge graph is provided below. Here is the question..."

### 4. Answer Evaluation
- Compare LLM answers with ground truth (A/B/C/D).
- Compute accuracy grouped by:
  - Method
  - Threat category (e.g., APT, Adware, Trojan)

### RQ2: Question Answering

We assess how well LLM4CTIâ€™s knowledge graphs support downstream question answering by LLMs. The evaluation is based on multiple-choice questions generated from CTI articles.

| Approach               | APT     | Adware  | Botnets | Spam & Phishing | Supply Chain Attacks | Trojan  | Virus   | Vulns & Exploits | **Average** |
|------------------------|---------|---------|---------|------------------|------------------------|---------|---------|-------------------|-------------|
| **LLM4CTI (Ours)**     | 98.33%  | 94.00%  | 86.00%  | 88.75%           | 92.00%                 | 86.00%  | 95.00%  | 86.00%            | **90.40%**  |
| CTIKG                  | 88.33%  | 92.00%  | 88.00%  | 86.25%           | 86.00%                 | 79.00%  | 91.67%  | 88.00%            | 86.60%      |
| GPT-4o                 | 96.67%  | 90.00%  | 78.00%  | 85.00%           | 94.00%                 | 85.00%  | 88.33%  | 88.00%            | 87.80%      |
| GPT-4o (No Graph)      | 66.67%  | 86.00%  | 80.00%  | 80.00%           | 76.00%                 | 75.00%  | 81.67%  | 78.00%            | 77.60%      |
